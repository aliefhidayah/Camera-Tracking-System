# Camera-Tracking-System
An interesting application of fuzzy control is the camera tracking control system at the Software Technology Laboratory, NASA/Johnson Space Center, used to investigate fuzzy logic approaches in autonomous orbital operations [Lea and Jani, 1992]. The camera tracking control system utilizes the tracked object's pixel position on the image as input and controls the gimbal drives to keep the object in the field of view (FOV) of the camera. Thus, tracking an object means aligning the pointing axis of a camera along the object's line of sight (LOS). The LOS vector is estimated from the sensory measurements.
